# Manifest System

Each MaiBot plugin must include a `_manifest.json` file in its root directory to declare plugin metadata, version compatibility, dependencies, and capability requirements. The Host-side `ManifestValidator` will strictly validate this file before loading.

## _manifest.json Structure

Here is a complete Manifest example:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "id": "com.example.my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "description": "An example plugin",
  "author": {
    "name": "Developer",
    "url": "https://github.com/developer"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "urls": {
    "repository": "https://github.com/developer/my-plugin",
    "homepage": "https://example.com",
    "documentation": "https://docs.example.com",
    "issues": "https://github.com/developer/my-plugin/issues"
  },
  "host_application": {
    "min_version": "1.0.0",
    "max_version": "1.99.99"
  },
  "sdk": {
    "min_version": "1.0.0",
    "max_version": "2.99.99"
  },
  "dependencies": [],
  "capabilities": ["send_message"],
  "i18n": {
    "default_locale": "zh-CN",
    "locales_path": "i18n",
    "supported_locales": ["zh-CN", "en-US"]
  }
}
```

## Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `manifest_version` | `2` | Manifest protocol version, currently fixed as `2` |
| `id` | string | Plugin unique identifier, format is lowercase letters/numbers, separated by dots or dashes (e.g., `com.author.plugin`) |
| `version` | string | Plugin version number, must be strict three-part semantic version (e.g., `1.0.0`) |
| `name` | string | Plugin display name |
| `description` | string | Plugin description |
| `author` | object | Plugin author information, contains `name` (author name) and `url` (author homepage, must be HTTP/HTTPS URL) |
| `license` | string | Plugin license |
| `urls` | object | Plugin related links collection (see below) |
| `host_application` | object | Host compatibility range (see below) |
| `sdk` | object | SDK compatibility range (see below) |
| `capabilities` | string[] | Plugin declared capability request list, cannot contain empty values |
| `i18n` | object | Internationalization configuration (see below) |

## Optional Fields

### urls Link Collection

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `repository` | Yes | Plugin repository address, must be HTTP/HTTPS URL |
| `homepage` | No | Plugin homepage address |
| `documentation` | No | Plugin documentation address |
| `issues` | No | Plugin issue feedback address |

### host_application / sdk Version Range

Both have the same structure, as closed interval declarations:

```json
{
  "min_version": "1.0.0",
  "max_version": "1.99.99"
}
```

- `min_version`: Allowed minimum version (closed interval)
- `max_version`: Allowed maximum version (closed interval)
- Both must be strict three-part semantic version numbers (`X.Y.Z`)
- `min_version` cannot be greater than `max_version`

Host will validate whether the current version falls within the declared range during handshake. If incompatible, the plugin will be blocked from loading.

### i18n Internationalization Configuration

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `default_locale` | Yes | Default language code (e.g., `zh-CN`) |
| `locales_path` | No | Language resource file directory path |
| `supported_locales` | No | Supported language list, cannot contain empty values and duplicates. If not empty, `default_locale` must exist in this list |

## Dependency Declaration

The `dependencies` array supports two types of dependencies, distinguished by the `type` field:

### Plugin-level Dependencies

```json
{
  "type": "plugin",
  "id": "com.example.other-plugin",
  "version_spec": ">=1.0.0,<2.0.0"
}
```

- `id`: ID of the dependency plugin, follows the same format rules as plugin ID
- `version_spec`: Version constraint expression, uses PEP 440 style (e.g., `>=1.0.0`, `~=1.0`)
- Circular dependencies or self-dependencies are not allowed
- Duplicate declarations of the same plugin dependency are not allowed

### Python Package Dependencies

```json
{
  "type": "python_package",
  "name": "httpx",
  "version_spec": ">=0.24.0"
}
```

- `name`: Python package name, only allows letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and dashes
- `version_spec`: Version constraint expression

### Dependency Resolution Process

`PluginDependencyPipeline` executes dependency analysis uniformly on the Host side:

1. **Scan**: Collect all plugins' `_manifest.json`
2. **Detect Host conflicts**: If plugin's Python package dependencies have no intersection with main program's dependency constraints, block loading
3. **Detect inter-plugin conflicts**: If multiple plugins have mutually exclusive version constraints for the same Python package, block all from loading
4. **Auto install**: For missing Python dependencies of loadable plugins, prefer `uv pip install`, fallback to `pip install`
5. **Topological sort**: Determine Runner startup order based on cross-Supervisor dependency relationships, circular dependencies will be rejected

## Validation Rules

The Manifest validator (`ManifestValidator`) uses Pydantic strict mode, with main validation rules including:

- **No extra fields**: Fields not declared in `_manifest.json` are not allowed
- **ID format**: Must match `^[a-z0-9]+(?:[.-][a-z0-9]+)+$` (e.g., `com.example.my-plugin`)
- **Version number format**: Must be `X.Y.Z` three-part format
- **URL format**: Must start with `http://` or `https://`
- **No self-dependency**: Cannot depend on itself in `dependencies`
- **No duplicate dependencies**: Same plugin/package name can only be declared once
