# Memory Management

Memory management is the most feature-rich module in WebUI, providing complete management capabilities for MaiBot's long-term memory system. The memory API routes (`/api/webui/memory/*`) are the largest code volume module among all routes, covering complete functions including graph operations, source management, memory fragments, character profiles, V5 memory actions, import, retrieval tuning, deletion and recovery.

## Knowledge Graph Management

MaiBot's long-term memory is stored in the form of a knowledge graph, consisting of nodes (Node) and edges (Edge).

### Graph Reading

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/graph` | Get graph data (can limit quantity, default 200, maximum 5000) |
| `GET /memory/graph/search` | Search graph (keywords + quantity limit) |
| `GET /memory/graph/node-detail` | Get node detailed information (including relationships, paragraphs, evidence nodes) |
| `GET /memory/graph/edge-detail` | Get edge detailed information (including paragraphs, evidence nodes) |

The node detail interface supports controlling the amount of returned data through `relation_limit`, `paragraph_limit`, `evidence_node_limit` parameters.

### Node Operations

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /memory/graph/node` | Create node (need to provide `name`) |
| `DELETE /memory/graph/node` | Delete node (need to provide `name`) |
| `POST /memory/graph/node/rename` | Rename node (need to provide `old_name` and `new_name`) |

### Edge Operations

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /memory/graph/edge` | Create edge (need to provide `subject`, `predicate`, `object`, optional `confidence`) |
| `DELETE /memory/graph/edge` | Delete edge (can locate through `hash` or `subject`+`object`) |
| `POST /memory/graph/edge/weight` | Modify edge weight (need to provide `weight`) |

## Source Management

Sources record the origin information of memory data, used for traceability and batch management.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/sources` | List all sources |
| `POST /memory/sources/delete` | Delete specified source |
| `POST /memory/sources/batch-delete` | Batch delete multiple sources |

## Memory Query

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/query/aggregate` | Aggregate query memory |

Aggregate query supports the following optional filter conditions:
- `query`: Search keywords
- `limit`: Return quantity limit (1-200)
- `chat_id`: Filter by chat ID
- `person_id`: Filter by person ID
- `time_start` / `time_end`: Filter by time range (Unix timestamp)

## Memory Fragment (Episode) Management

Memory fragments are processed memory units containing structured information extracted from original conversations.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/episodes` | List memory fragments (supports search, source, person, time filtering) |
| `GET /memory/episodes/{episode_id}` | Get single memory fragment details |
| `POST /memory/episodes/rebuild` | Rebuild memory fragments (by source or all) |
| `GET /memory/episodes/status` | Get memory fragment processing status |
| `POST /memory/episodes/process-pending` | Process pending memory fragments |

The `process-pending` interface supports `limit` (1-200) and `max_retry` (1-20) parameters to control batch processing scale and retry upper limit.

## Character Profile Management

Character profiles store MaiBot's understanding and cognition of each user.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/profiles/query` | Query character profiles (supports search by person_id or keywords) |
| `GET /memory/profiles` | List all character profiles |
| `POST /memory/profiles/override` | Set character profile override text |
| `DELETE /memory/profiles/override/{person_id}` | Delete character profile override |

The profile override function allows manual modification of a user's profile description, and the override text will take precedence over automatically generated profiles.

## Feedback Correction Management

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/feedback-corrections` | List feedback correction records (supports status and rollback status filtering) |
| `GET /memory/feedback-corrections/{task_id}` | Get single correction details |
| `POST /memory/feedback-corrections/{task_id}/rollback` | Roll back a correction operation |

## V5 Memory Actions

The V5 memory system provides more refined memory manipulation capabilities:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/v5/status` | Get V5 memory status |
| `GET /memory/v5/recycle-bin` | Get V5 recycle bin content |
| `POST /memory/v5/reinforce` | Reinforce memory (increase memory strength) |
| `POST /memory/v5/weaken` | Weaken memory (decrease memory strength) |
| `POST /memory/v5/remember-forever` | Permanent memory (mark as never forget) |
| `POST /memory/v5/forget` | Forget memory (move to recycle bin) |
| `POST /memory/v5/restore` | Restore memory (restore from recycle bin) |

All V5 actions support `target` (target identifier), `strength` (optional strength coefficient), `reason` (operation reason) parameters.

## Deletion Management

Deletion operations adopt a preview-execute-restore safety mode:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /memory/delete/preview` | Preview deletion impact (no actual deletion) |
| `POST /memory/delete/execute` | Execute deletion |
| `POST /memory/delete/restore` | Restore deleted content |
| `GET /memory/delete/operations` | List deletion operation history |
| `GET /memory/delete/operations/{operation_id}` | Get single deletion operation details |
| `POST /memory/delete/purge` | Completely clear deleted data (supports grace period) |

The `purge` interface's `grace_hours` parameter can be used to retain recently deleted data within a certain number of hours, and the `limit` parameter controls the amount cleared in a single operation (1-5000).

## Memory Import

Memory import functionality supports importing external data into long-term memory in multiple ways:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/import/settings` | Get import settings |
| `GET /memory/import/path-aliases` | Get path aliases |

| `POST /memory/import/tasks/{task_id}/cancel` | Cancel import task |
| `POST /memory/import/tasks/{task_id}/retry` | Retry failed import tasks |

When uploading files for import, files are first temporarily stored in subdirectories under the `data/memory_upload_staging/` directory and automatically cleaned up after import completion.

Retrieval tuning functionality is used to optimize memory retrieval effects:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /memory/retrieval_tuning/settings` | Get tuning settings |
| `GET /memory/retrieval_tuning/profile` | Get current tuning configuration |

## Compatible Routes

For backward compatibility, some old interfaces are also mounted under the `/api/webui/api/*` path (`compat_router`), including graph operations, source management, and memory queries. New development should prioritize using the `/memory/*` path.
